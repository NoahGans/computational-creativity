With this project I tried to go for a simple solution that would make pretty good music. In music there are plenty of rules that allow for beautiful pieces to be made, but hard coding in all of these rules would be extremely tedious. Instead, I thought about generating a melody using the g-major scale and determining the next note by looking at similar occurrences of the notes that had just been played and seeing what notes came after them. This made for a song that kept similar motifs, sounds, and notes through the whole piece. The chord section was built from the melody part, so it follows these tendencies too. The song attached starts out a little random, gets more consistent, and then becomes a little monotonous. This is because as the song continues the next note chosen is extremely favorable to those that have been chosen and not random ones. Fun things to edit in the code are the random numbers at the start of the main function. The number that dictates the size of pattern observed, and the score that is received by matching pitch or rhythm. I hope you enjoy.

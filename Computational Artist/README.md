Computational Creativity Artist:

Title:
Crafty Line Boii

Running Instructions:
The code should just run with a simple terminal command, now arguments are required. 

Description:

Crafty Line Boii(CLB) is an attempt at creating a computationally creative computer program that uses turtle to place lines on a screen. I was not familiar with other graphical creative tools, but had I worked with turtle in python, so I wanted to give it a shot in java. This was a difficult problem mostly because Processor Harmon could not have chosen a more open-ended goal. This program functions by creating elements that are composed for different components. Components are selected through a Markov Process. Elements are different individual conglomerations of lines and shapes of different colors and textures(widths). 
	This was a tough project and I ended up caring about it a little too much. Unlike most CS projects where most of the thinking is figuring out how to get from A to B, this one required a lot of thought about what B was. This was a pain, but also quite fun. I’m guessing professor Harmon chose art because it is so difficult to quantify and therefore so hard to program. My First year seminar was all about defining art by looking at it change throughout history. I remember walking away from that class thinking that arts soul purpose was to be a definable thing. Art is bound by nothing. This was both nice and horrible. Nice because no matter what I produced it was art, but horrible because it’s difficult to draw the line of how much effort to put in. This project was a neat return to that FYS thinking, but with the ultimate goal of coming up with some definition. 
	This project was extremely difficult, because there is no heuristic for good art. I didn’t want to limit its creative ability, but also needed to give it some structure so it wasn’t totally random. I spent a long time just thinking about a goal state… what I wanted this thing to look like. I knew that I was using turtle and the art work would likely be 2d, and I decided on using the elements and principals of design(EPD) for art to guide my artist. I couldn’t address all the EPD, but I captured some of them in my code. Combining this idea with a Markov process was difficult, but I think came together well. This was far more challenging than other CS projects, because unlike most I had to not only figure out the solution, but also the problem. This is what made it an important challenge, and I hope that these heuristic developing challenges can be applied to more concrete problems. 
	I don’t think that CLB is that creative. Unfortunately, I think I defined the problem a little to rigorously, and it makes CLB a little predictable. An important part of creativity is creating your own rules, but CLB simply follows rules. I think it’s also valuable for a creative thing to have passion for its creativeness and pursue its ideas, exhaust them, and move onto new ones. CLB does none of this, so CLB is not that creative.
